        The main utility idea of our project is to rescue the wild tiger population in the world. Over the past 100 years, their amount has decreased by 97%, falling from 100 thousand to 3890. Even though for the first time in the past 10 years, their number did not decrease, but increased from 3200 to 3890, they remain endangered due to poaching and illegal wildlife trade as well as environmentally damaging of wild tigers habitats. Therefore our team has set off on the mission to oppose the extinction of wild tigers by bringing NFT as a tool to rescue these beautiful cats. With the help of NFT community - where you can be part of our "Wild Tigers Rescue Club," we can help together to save these truly amazing animals! We will donate 2ETH to WWF organization after achieving every point on our Road Map.

        WTRC (Wild Tigers Rescue Club) it's a unique collection of 3000 programmatically, voxel NFTs from over 115 possible traits (including types, headwear, outfits, emotions, and backgrounds). 
        The Tigers are stored as an ERC-721 token on the Ethereum blockchain and hosted on IPFS.
        The entire collection was hand-drawn by our designer and generated by our developer.
<p>In order to make the fairest distribution of our collection, it will be not revealed which NFT Tiger you are going to buy - therefore all of our supporters will be under the same conditions while purchasing our NFT Tigers. The minting price for each item will be 0.04 ETH + gas fee with the maximum of 20 tigers per one transaction.</p>
